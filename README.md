Hello!



**Who am I?**

My name is Kevin, I'm an independent data scientist and infinitely curious person.



**What I'm good at?**

Python | SQL | Data Visualization | Machine Learning

**My Projects**

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

*[Predicting Yelp Ratings For Restaurants](https://github.com/johnsonk5/yelp_project/blob/main/Predicting%20Yelp%20Ratings%20for%20Restaurants.ipynb)*

- Created a function to retrieve data from the Yelp API and used it to retrieve data about restaurants for several cities in the US. 
- Cleaned this data and prepared it for use in a Linear Regression model. My model was able to predict Yelp ratings with an average error of about 1/2 stars.

*[Pitchfork Over the Years](https://github.com/johnsonk5/pitchfork/blob/main/Pitchfork%20Over%20the%20Years.ipynb)*

- Used Matplotlib to produce several visualizations of long term trends for the ratings on the online music magazine Pitchfork. 
- Used SQL to produce summary statistics about the data. In this project, I found that Pitchfork's scores have been rising since 2009 as a result of a decline in the number of low scoring reviews.


**What I'm interested in working on?**

I'm happy to collaborate on anything! 
But in particular, I'm interested in economics and social sciences. I also love food and music.
I'd be happy to work on anything in those areas or anything else!
